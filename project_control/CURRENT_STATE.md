## Slice-07 implementation state

`TASK-S07-001 — Email Outbox and History Trusted Persistence Contracts` remains accepted at `checkpoint/S07-001-accepted-001` → `8397be35d64a65f4a693811e4fc6b9e43287a7cd`.

`TASK-S07-002 — Document Scan Request and Result-Fencing Trusted Contracts` is accepted at `checkpoint/S07-002-accepted-001` → `d99776aa6e07c0023ada9906211f6d1d4b17f5ed`.

- Candidate exact review R9: PASS; integration equivalence review: PASS; source reopen false.
- Final acceptance Integration CI [34765432362](https://github.com/oanhpham-kobe/eiu-recruitment/actions/runs/34765432362) at exact `d99776aa6e07c0023ada9906211f6d1d4b17f5ed`: PASS. One checkpoint-tag dispatch with `full_verification=true`; resolver, Web, Database, document scan protocol regression and claim/fencing concurrency assertions all PASS.
- Prior exact-SHA run [34764835368](https://github.com/oanhpham-kobe/eiu-recruitment/actions/runs/34764835368) at `d99776aa6e07c0023ada9906211f6d1d4b17f5ed`: resolver PASS, Web/Database skipped; insufficient final acceptance domain verification. Earlier DB+Web evidence at `c9f8f3a` and Web evidence at `f0dc231` remain supporting evidence only.
- Checkpoint unchanged: annotated tag object `105506f6e68e1acb4e1b0cf732bbe5beb2b66136` peels to accepted commit `d99776aa6e07c0023ada9906211f6d1d4b17f5ed`. Existing reviews remain valid; no new review or product/test/migration changes for CI closure.
- Reporting HEAD resolves from Git; accepted SHA → reporting HEAD is governance-only. Later automatic reporting CI is not the accepted product CI.
- The accepted scope provides durable scan-request identity, worker result fencing, candidate continuation and deferred cleanup intent. It does not implement scanner-provider runtime, a physical Storage-cleanup worker, deployment, or a connected Supabase operation.
- Owner-transported external ChatGPT final audit: PASS, source reopen false; acceptance lifecycle CLOSED and prompt-gate-only frontier release recorded in `916febb43fb5ab87b1065de677bbcfaed4c74cf5`.
`TASK-S07-003 — Storage Cleanup Eligibility and Result-Fencing Trusted Contracts` is accepted at `checkpoint/S07-003-accepted-001` → `7317138779270087e3e425f48b13785923b17f42`.

- Candidate implementation reviewed by External ChatGPT: PASS (`c150603d9e9de4731e5b4e6215126de637bfe7e3`). Final acceptance SHA: `7317138779270087e3e425f48b13785923b17f42` (with accepted CI wiring in `.github/workflows/integration-ci.yml`).
- Final acceptance Integration CI [34979021250](https://github.com/oanhpham-kobe/eiu-recruitment/actions/runs/34979021250) at exact `7317138779270087e3e425f48b13785923b17f42`: PASS. Resolver, Web verification, Database integration with all three S07-003 gates (SQL contract, concurrency/fencing, upgrade path), crossed regressions, and DB lint all PASS.
- Final acceptance Governance CI [34979021519](https://github.com/oanhpham-kobe/eiu-recruitment/actions/runs/34979021519) at exact `7317138779270087e3e425f48b13785923b17f42`: PASS.
- Checkpoint verified: annotated tag object `a2702995bb1b475d003ad8e85d4a2c58b7fcd75c` peels to accepted commit `7317138779270087e3e425f48b13785923b17f42`.
- Roles & Reviewers: OMP was producer; External ChatGPT was independent implementation and final acceptance reviewer under an Owner-authorized task-local override. No `eiu-reviewer` implementation review was used.
- The accepted scope hardens existing database cleanup eligibility and lease fencing contracts. It does not implement a physical Storage-cleanup worker/runner, scanner/email provider runtimes, deployment, or connected Supabase operations.
- Owner-transported external ChatGPT final acceptance audit: PASS, source reopen false, implementation reopen false; acceptance lifecycle CLOSED.
- `TASK-S07-004 — Physical Storage Cleanup Runner and Local Storage Integration` is now IN_PROGRESS after Owner-authorized implementation dispatch. Source reconciliation: `project_control/reviews/S07_004_SOURCE_RECONCILIATION_v1.md`; prompt: `project_control/prompts/SLICE-07_TASK-004_v1.md`; immutable implementation baseline: `checkpoint/pre-S07-004-002` → `9af517c0f83af1c3337f6e7b12dd50595aaea9f0`.
- Independent prompt re-review by eiu-reviewer (`S07-004-PROMPT-REVIEW-003` @ `06f8635da5438424a69e0cff12e91fc2389dfd48`): PASS, source reopen false. External ChatGPT prompt-gate re-audit: PASS with pre-implementation governance reconciliation.
- Owner role override `S07-004-OWNER-ROLE-OVERRIDE-001`: ChatGPT is implementation producer/executor; OMP/`eiu-reviewer` is independent implementation reviewer. ChatGPT may not self-accept S07-004. Implementation branch: `chatgpt/TASK-S07-004-physical-storage-cleanup-runner`.
- No task beyond S07-004 is materialized; production deployment, connected Supabase operations, scanner/email provider runtimes, production scheduler/daemon, and TASK-S07-005 remain strictly out of scope.

## Scope boundary

Current execution is authorized only for TASK-S07-004 implementation on the dedicated task branch, using disposable local Supabase for physical Storage integration. ChatGPT is the producer/executor and must stop at an exact candidate for OMP independent review. No serialization, accepted checkpoint, deployment, connected Supabase mutation, `main` mutation, PR merge, or subsequent task is authorized in this phase.
