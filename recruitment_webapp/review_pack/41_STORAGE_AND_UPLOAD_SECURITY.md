# 41. Storage & Upload Security — v1.8

## Approved file policy
- PDF: `.pdf`
- Word: `.doc`, `.docx`
- PowerPoint: `.ppt`, `.pptx`
- Images: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`
- **5 MB maximum per file**
- **5 current files maximum per Submission and per Interview Session**
- Candidate form: CV required; Degree/Transcript/Certificate/Other optional.

Reject HTML, SVG, executable, script, archive and unapproved formats. Extension alone is insufficient: validate claimed MIME and content signature/magic bytes where feasible.

## Buckets
Private buckets only. No public CV/degree/report/demo URL. Browser gets short-lived authorized signed URL; initial target TTL 1–5 minutes for sensitive documents.

## Two-phase protocol
1. `reserve_upload` authorizes actor, parent, intended type/count/size and creates temp/quarantine path.
2. Client/server uploads object to temp path.
3. Validation verifies extension/MIME/signature/size and **mandatory production malware scan** before final promotion.
4. Lock parent, enforce max current files, insert metadata/version atomically, switch current version, retire previous version.
5. Async cleanup removes expired/orphan temp objects.

DB rollback cannot rollback Object Storage, so direct “upload then hope metadata insert succeeds” is prohibited.

## Preview/download
PDF/image may preview in hardened same-origin viewer where safe. Word/PPT normally download unless a vetted converter/viewer is added. Never inline-render arbitrary HTML/SVG.

## Path/metadata
Server-generated object key; preserve original filename only as metadata; normalize header/content-disposition; unique bucket/path; checksum when available.

## Candidate staged upload/edit protocol
1. Open short-lived Candidate Form Session (NEW or EDIT); persisted lifecycle is `OPEN → SUBMITTED | CANCELLED | EXPIRED` only.
2. Reserve temp/quarantine path against Form Session; no Submission ID is required for a new form.
3. Validate extension + declared/detected MIME + magic bytes + 5 MB limit.
4. Run malware scan; because DOC/PPT are allowed, `CLEAN` is mandatory before finalization.
5. Candidate document ADD/REPLACE/DELETE remains pending in form session; stage requires Form Session `OPEN` and unexpired, and ADD/REPLACE reservation unexpired.
6. Submit/Save locks parent/session, synchronously re-checks Form Session `OPEN` + unexpired, Candidate active + Submission NEW for edits, calls the authoritative staged-plan validator (`private.validate_candidate_form_document_plan()` or its migration-equivalent), validates max 5 effective current files + required current CV + every staged ADD/REPLACE as unexpired + `VALIDATED/CLEAN`, then atomically writes logical headers/versions and marks staged changes applied.
7. Cancel/expiry cleans pending objects; persisted current versions remain unchanged. Async cleanup is housekeeping only; wall-clock expiry blocks Stage/Save/Submit/Finalize synchronously.
8. Image EXIF/geolocation metadata is stripped where practical before final object promotion.

Logical model uses a header (`submission_document_logicals` / `interview_document_logicals`) that fixes parent + `document_type_id`, and version rows cannot switch parent/type.

## Interview reservation / hard-delete protocol
- `upload_reservations.interview_id` is a real FK to `interviews(interview_id)` with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`; an Interview reservation cannot reference a nonexistent parent.
- Interview hard-delete must lock parent + reservations, durably insert each temp bucket/path into `storage_cleanup_queue`, then cancel/remove reservation rows before deleting the Interview.
- Durable cleanup-capture failure blocks the hard-delete. The Storage cleanup worker may run later, but the cleanup intent must already survive the parent deletion.
- `is_structurally_empty_default_round()` remains a business-history predicate; temp reservations are a separate **cleanup prerequisite**, not a reason to pretend the Round has meaningful recruitment history.
- FK cascade is forbidden for Interview reservations because PostgreSQL deletion cannot remove the corresponding Object Storage object transactionally.
